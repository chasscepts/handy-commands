# Handy Commands

Handy Commands is a Visual Studio Code extension for organizing commands that we frequently run on the command line. Sometimes we forget that command we want to run, and we will leave our development environment to search for it. That is not productive. With Handy Commands, you organize them into groups of related commands and run them with the click of the mouse. If some part of the command changes from run to run, you can paste and edit it in the terminal. If you no longer frequently use a command, you can delete it. And by organizing them into groups, they will not clutter your workspace.
From v0.0.2, Handy Commands automatically imports the scripts defined in package.json and puts them in their group (Npm Scripts). It watches changes to package.json and updates this group as the script changes.
